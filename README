    Proxmox VE plugin to deal with Dell Equallogic PS-series SAN.

For this plugin, you need to set "uid_attribute ID_PATH" in multipatch.conf.
To do it only for Dell SANs (if you are using also some other multipath
SANs here), you may use per-device definition like this:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
devices {
        device {
                vendor          "EQLOGIC"
                product         "100E-00"
                uid_attribute   ID_PATH
                path_checker    tur
        }
}
----------------------------------------------------------------------

PVE currently does not provide interface to add custom storage plugins,
so you need to add it manually into /etc/pve/storage.cfg.

Config section looks ilike that:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
dellps: dellstor
        login somelogin
        password somepassword
        adminaddr X.X.X.X
        groupaddr Y.Y.Y.Y
        pool default
        content images
        shared 1
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Plugin currently does not sets any security settings to target storage.

Info how to set up iSCSI multipath at system and open-iscsi levels, see
https://linux.dell.com/files/whitepapers/iSCSI_Multipathing_in_Ubuntu_Server.pdf
(but do not set node startup to automatic).

Also, Debian multipath-tools currently have bug 
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=799781
which will lead to long volumes activation times. To workaround it, comment-out
(or delete) rule in /lib/udev/rules.d/60-multipath.rules WARNING: this way may
be dangerous if you are using multipath boot.
